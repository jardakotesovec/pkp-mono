//
// Common variables
//
// These variables set common standards to be used throughout pkp-lib and its
// associated projects. Unless a particular project is deliberately supposed
// to be distinguished in style, such as a custom theme, it should make use of
// these variables to define common sizing, colors and typography.
//

// Import variables from the ui-library
@import '../../ui-library/src/styles/variables.less';

// Base URL
// The base URL is set appropriately before the LESS stylesheet is compiled and
// will point to the site's base directory. The variable can be used to point
// to image and font assets.
@baseUrl:                   ''; // Leave empty
