 * @brief A global event router to pass events between handlers. This is an
 *  adaptation of the Observer pattern. Instead of allowing handlers to
 *  subscribe to events, all event responses are defined in the eventRouter.
 *  This is a workaround for the lapsed listener problem, in which handlers will
 *  leave obsolete listeners around in the eventRouter as they're refreshed and
 *  re-initialized. This is because we don't have any central handler registry,
 *  and can't track handler removals which occur due to changes in the DOM.
