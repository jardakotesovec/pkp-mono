<p>Thank you for downloading the Public Knowledge Project's <strong>Open Monograph Press</strong>. Before proceeding, please read the <a href="{$baseUrl}/docs/README">README</a> file included with this software. For more information about the Public Knowledge Project and its software projects, please visit the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">PKP web site</a>. If you have bug reports or technical support inquiries about Open Monograph Press, see the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum">support forum</a> or visit PKP's online <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/bugzilla/" target="_blank">bug reporting system</a>. Although the support forum is the preferred method of contact, you can also email the team at <a href="mailto:pkp-support@sfu.ca">pkp-support@sfu.ca</a>.</p>

<h4>Upgrade</h4>

<p>If you are upgrading an existing installation of OMP 0.x, <a href="{$upgradeUrl}">click here</a> to proceed.</p>

<h4>Recommended system requirements</h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank">PHP</a> >= {$phpRequiredVersion} (including PHP 5.x); you are currently using PHP {$phpVersion}{$wrongPhpText}</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> >= 3.23.23 (including MySQL 4.x) or <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> >= 7.1 (including PostgreSQL 8.x)</li>
	<li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache</a> >= 1.3.2x or >= 2.0.4x or Microsoft IIS 6</li>
	<li>Operating system: Any OS that supports the above software, including <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_blank">Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.bsd.org/" target="_blank">BSD</a>, <a href="http://www.sun.com/" target="_blank">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Windows</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As PKP does not have the resources to test every possible combination of software versions and platforms, no guarantee of correct operation or support is implied.</p>

<p>Changes to these settings can be made after installation by editing the file <tt>config.inc.php</tt> in the base OMP directory, or using the site administration web interface.</p>

<h4>Supported database systems</h4>

<p>OMP has currently only been tested on MySQL and PostgreSQL, although other database management systems supported by <a href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">ADOdb</a> may work (in full or partially). Compatibility reports and/or code patches for alternative DBMSs can be sent to the OMP team.</p>

<h4>Pre-Installation Steps</h4>

<p>1. The following files and directories (and their contents) must be made writable:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>config.inc.php</tt> is writable (optional): {$writable_config}</li>
	<li><tt>public/</tt> is writable: {$writable_public}</li>
	<li><tt>cache/</tt> is writable: {$writable_cache}</li>
	<li><tt>cache/t_cache/</tt> is writable: {$writable_templates_cache}</li>
	<li><tt>cache/t_compile/</tt> is writable: {$writable_templates_compile}</li>
	<li><tt>cache/_db</tt> is writable: {$writable_db_cache}</li>
</ul>

<p>2. A directory to store uploaded files must be created and made writable (see "File Settings" below).</p>

<h4>Manual installation</h4>

<p>Select <strong>Manual Install</strong> to display the SQL statements necessary to create the OMP database schema and initial data so that database installation can be performed manually. This option is useful when debugging installation problems, particularly on unsupported platforms. Note that this installation method will not attempt to create the database or any tables, although the configuration file will still be written with the supplied database settings.</p>]]></message>

	<message key="default.pressSettings.copyeditInstructions"><![CDATA[The copyediting stage is intended to improve the flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting of the article. It represents the last chance for the author to make any substantial changes to the text, as the next stage is restricted to typos and formatting corrections. 

The file to be copyedited is in Word or .rtf format and therefore can be easily edited as a word processing document. This set of  instructions displayed here proposes two approaches to copyediting. The one is based on Microsoft Word's Track Changes feature and requires that the copyeditor, editor and author have access to this program. A second system, that is software independent, has been borrowed, with permission, from the Harvard Educational Review. The press editor is in a position to modify these instructions, so suggestions can be made to improve the process for this press. 

<h4>Copyediting Systems</h4>

<strong>1. Microsoft Word's Track Changes</strong>

Under Tools in the menu bar, the feature Track Changes enables the copyeditor to make insertions (text appears in color) and deletions (text appears crossed out in color or in the margins as deleted). The copyeditor can post queries to both the author (Author Queries) and to the editor (Editor Queries) by inserting these queries in square brackets. The copyedited version is then uploaded and the editor is notified. The editor then reviews the text and notifies the author. 

The editor and author should leave those changes with which they are satisfied. If further changes are necessary, the editor and author can make changes to the initial insertions or deletions, as well as make new insertions or deletions elsewhere in the text. Authors and editors should respond to each of the queries addressed to them, with responses placed inside the square brackets. 

After the text has been reviewed by editor and author, the copyeditor will make a final pass over the text accepting the changes in preparation for the layout and galley stage. 


<strong>2. Harvard Educational Review </strong>

<strong>Instructions for Making Electronic Revisions to the Manuscript</strong>

Please follow the following protocol for making electronic revisions to your manuscript:

<strong>Responding to suggested changes</strong>
&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you accept, unbold the text
&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you do not accept, re-enter the original text and <strong>bold</strong> it

<strong>Making additions and deletions</strong>
&nbsp; Indicate additions by <strong>bolding</strong> the new text
&nbsp; Replace deleted sections with: <strong>[deleted text]</strong>
&nbsp; If you delete a sentence or more, please indicate with a note, e.g., <strong>[deleted 2 sentences]</strong>

<strong>Responding to Queries to the Author (QAs)</strong>
&nbsp; Keep all QAs intact and bolded within the text. Do not delete them
&nbsp; To reply to a QA, add a comment after it. Comments should be delimited using:
<strong>[Comment:</strong>]
&nbsp; e.g., <strong>[Comment: Expanded discussion of methodology as you suggested]</strong>

<strong>Making comments</strong>
&nbsp; Use comments to explain organizational changes or major revisions
&nbsp; e.g., <strong>[Comment: Moved the above paragraph from p. 5 to p. 7]</strong>
&nbsp; Note: When referring to page numbers, please use the page numbers from the printed copy of the manuscript that was sent to you. This is important since page numbers may change as a document is revised electronically.

<h4>An Illustration of an Electronic Revision</h4>

Before making dramatic departures from the structure and organization of your original manuscript, please check in with the co-chairs of your piece. After you are finished with your revisions, rename the file from AuthorNameQA.doc to AuthorNameQAR.doc (e.g., from LeeQA.doc to LeeQAR.doc). Print out a hardcopy of your manuscript and mail it with a floppy disk containing the completely revised and renamed word processing file.
