	<section title="Main Site Home Page">
		<![CDATA[<p>Upon accessing the Main Site Home Page you will be
provided with a description of the site as a whole, and a list of presses
residing on the site. From here you can access a press's Home Page, access any
available current monographs, and also register with the press. The Main Site
navigation features break down as follows:</p><p><strong>Top Navigation
Bar</strong></p><p><em>Home</em> and <em>About</em> provide information about
the site (as opposed to an individual press).</p><p><em>Log In</em> allows you
to create a user profile if you have not already done so. See {help_topic
key="user.registerAndProfile" text="Register and Profile"}. The Log In link will
be replaced with a User Home link once you register and log in. See {help_topic
key="user.userHome" text="User Home"}.</p><p><em>Register</em> allows you to add
a press to your User Home Page.</p><p><em>Search</em> allows you to search the
entire site or just an individual press.  See {help_topic
key="user.searchAndBrowse" text="Search and Browse"}.</p><p><strong>Right
Navigation Bar</strong></p><p>The <em>Open Monograph Press</em> link will take
you to the Public Knowledge Project website, which provides resources for Open
Monograph Press and other related software.</p><p>The <em>Press Help</em>
link provides context sensitive help.</p><p>The form under the <em>User</em>
heading allows you to log in if you have a username and password.  After logging
in you will be taken to your User Home page. Once logged in, there will be links
under <em>User</em> to a list of presses you have registered to; to your
profile; and to log out.</p><p><em>Language</em> allows you to choose a language
supported by OMP.</p><p>The search field under <em>Press Content</em> allows
you to search the site in a basic variety of ways. For a more comprehensive
search, click the Search link on the top navigation bar.</p>	<p><em>Font
Size</em> allows you to make the site font size smaller or bigger.</p>]]>
