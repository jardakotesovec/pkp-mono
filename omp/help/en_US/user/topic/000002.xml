		<![CDATA[<p>In About the Press, the press presents its policies, procedures and other relevant material, with the intention of making the workings of the press as transparent as possible. This is the material that is typically referred to as the front matter in presses. It is where potential authors for this press can learn about the scope and focus of the press, its Peer Review Policy, and how to format and prepare a submission, as well as how to submit a monograph to the press.</p>]]>
