		<![CDATA[<p>Submissions in this queue are subject to review and a decision by the Acquisitions Editor to accept or decline the submission. The extent of the review process is spelled out in the press's Review Policy (e.g., Is every Section of the press subject to Peer Review? How many peer Reviewers per submission?). When a Acquisitions Editor or an Editor clicks on a submission title in the In Review Queue, they are taken to the submission's Review page. If the Acquisitions Editor accepts a submission, it moves to the In Editing queue; if declined, it moves to the Archives.</p>]]>
