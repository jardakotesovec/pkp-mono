		<![CDATA[<p>The Press Manager is able to create different
acquisitions arrangements within the press in Series/Submission Categories,
under Press Management. A press might typically include such arrangements as
Monographs, Book Reviews, Series, Subject Categories, Editorial, etc.</p>
<p>If Acquisitions Editors are to be used, the Press Manager
is able to specify Acquisitions Editors who may be assigned to see through the
editorial process those submissions that have been submitted to the Acquisitions Arrangement.
(The Editor assigns submissions in the {help_topic
key="editorial.editorsRole.submissions.unassigned" text="Unassigned"}
submissions queue to one of the designated Acquisitions Editors as part of the
Editorial Process).</p><p><em>Creating a Acquisitions Arrangements
policy</em>. In setting up an Acquisitions Arrangements, the Press Manager should enter a brief
Policy Statement for the Acquisitions Arrangements, which will be made available to authors and
readers in About the Press under Acquisitions Arrangements Policies. The statement should describe
the scope of the Acquisitions Arrangements and type of submissions sought. It should include
information on whether submissions to the acquisitions arrangements are peer reviewed and indexed,
whether the Acquisitions Arrangements is open or restricted to invited work (or to Editors), the
desired length for the monographs, etc.</p>
		<p><em>Specifying a Review Form</em>. The Press Manager can specify a {help_topic key="press.managementPages.reviewForms" text="custom review form"} to be used in place of the default free-form set of text boxes. The form chosen here will be the new default, but Editors will be able to override this default when choosing a reviewer, if need be.</p> 
		<p><em>Indexing the contents of a Acquisitions Arrangements</em>. Items in a acquisitions arrangement should be indexed if they contribute to the literature (which is not the case, for example, with an acquisitions arrangement devoted to conference announcements or job notices). The indexing option will enable authors to enter the relevant metadata for indexing the items which they submit. The metadata will be made available to research search engines that adhere to the Open Archives Initiative Metadata Harvesting Protocol and to other indexing services once the item has been published. Items in Acquisitions Arrangements that are indexed will also have their authors added to the Author List on the Search page and will be accompanied by the Reading Tools selected by the Press Manager for this press.</p><p><em>Enabling or disabling abstracts</em>. Some acquisitions arrangemnt, such as Book Reviews, will not require abstracts; this option allows the Press Manager to disable abstracts for the acquisitions arrangement. When abstracts are disabled, they will not be requested in the monograph submission process, or displayed in the Table of Contents.</p><p><em>Configuring item identification</em>. When presenting metadata to viewers or to external systems (e.g. via OAI harvesting), the item's type must be identified. For example, an item could be a peer-reviewed monograph, non-refereed monograph, invited monograph, etc.</p><p><em>Restricting the contents of a Acquisitions Arrangement</em>. The Restrictions box should be checked for Acquisitions Arrangements of the press (such as Editorials or Interviews) that are not open to author submissions in an unrestricted way. Restricted submissions must come from the editors or are invited. Such an acquisitions arrangement can only be submitted to by authors who are also registered as Editors or Acquisitions Editors.</p><p><em>Hiding the acquisitions arrangement title in the Table of Contents</em>. It may be desirable to solicit submissions for an arrangement and/or organize published monographs into an arrangement but hide the name of the arrangement when presenting it to readers.</p><p><em>About</em>. You may wish to remove information about this arrangement from appearing in About the Press. This is useful if, for instance, you have a Press Acquisitions Arrangement that only updates very occasionally, or an errata arrangement.</p>]]>
