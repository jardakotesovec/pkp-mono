		<![CDATA[<p>From the Press Management page, the Press Manager can enable the Fee Payment Module to accept payments, either via PayPal or through a manual process, for author fees and monograph access. The Fee Payment Module keeps track of paid users, and also displays fee information in the press's About page. Additionally, with the Fee Payment Module enabled it is possible for users to renew subscriptions and memberships from their User Home page.</p><p>The Fee Payment module is split into three different subacquisitionsArrangements: Fee Payment Options, Fee Payment Methods, and Records.</p>]]>

<section title="Fee Payment Options">
<![CDATA[<p>The first step to setting up the Payments module is to activate all desired options on the Fee Payment Options Page.</p><p><em>General Options</em><br />The Payments module can be turned on and off under General Options, and the currency can be selected as well. Please note that your currency selection in the Payments module should match your subscription currency, if subscriptions are also being used.</p><p><em>Author Fees</em><br />The Press Manager can enable individual fees for Monograph Submission, Fast-Track Review, and Monograph Publication under the Author Fees heading. Additionally, the Press Manager can edit the fee amounts, titles, and descriptions for each, and can edit a general waiver policy as well. All of this information will appear on the About page under Author Fees, and will also appear in the Author's submission process.</p><p>If enabled, the Monograph Submission fee must be paid by the Author before Step 5 of the monograph submission process is completed. Authors will be able to request a waiver and can still submit the monograph, however, but the request must be reviewed by the Editor from the Unassigned Submission page.</p><p>The Fast-Track Review fee, if enabled, is optional and as such does not have to be paid to complete the submission process. If paid, the submission is coloured grey in the Editor's submission tracking queues to note that it is a fast-track submission.</p><p>If the Monograph Publication fee is enabled, the Author must pay the requested fee before the monograph is published. This fee does not have to be paid at the time of monograph submission. The Author will receive notification from the Editor on acceptance of the monograph for publication, and must then log in and pay the Monograph Publication; this can be done from the Author's Active Submission queue. As with the Monograph Submission fee, the Author can request that this fee be waived as well.</p><p><em>Reader Fees</em><br />The Press Manager can enable fee payments for Subscriptions, as well as for Monograph Pay-Per-View payments.</p><p>If Subscription payments are enabled, subscribed users will be able to renew their subscription from their User Home page. Please note that subscriptions are not automatically updated on receipt of payment. Subscription payments will appear on the Payment Records page with a link to the corresponding user subscription page, but the user's subscription will have to be manually renewed on that subscription page by either the Press Manager or Subscription Manager.</p><p>If Monograph Pay-Per-View payments are enabled, access to subscription-protected content will be available on a per-monograph basis. Users must be registered with the press to purchase content. Once purchased, users will have ongoing access to said content.</p><p><em>General Fees</em><br />Under General Fees, The Press Manager can enable Association Membership fee payment and Donations to the press.</p><p>If the Association Membership fee payment option is enabled, its description will appear in About the Press, under Policies. Registered users will also have the option of paying membership fees from their User Home.</p><p>If the Donation fee payment option is enabled, a Donations link will appear, located on the right navigational bar by default. Clicking this link will allow registered users to donate to the press by using whichever fee payment method the Press Manager selects.</p>]]>

<section title="Fee Payment Methods">
	<![CDATA[<p>The Press Manager has the option of enabling either Manual Fee Payment or PayPal Fee Payment from this page. This choice dictates whether users will encounter a PayPal or a Manual Fee Payment page wherever they wish to make a payment.</p><p><em>Manual Fee Payment</em><br />If this option is selected, the Press Manager must also include instructions for users to make manual payments, ie., whom to contact, or where to mail a payment. These instructions will appear on a Manual Fee Payment page wherever a payment is required: at time of monograph submission, for example, or when a user wishes to renew a subscription or membership.</p><p>When the Manual Fee Payment is enabled, the Editor must manually mark Submission, Fast-Track Review and Publication fees as either paid or waived. This can be done from the submission Summary page, and appropriate records will appear on the payments Records page.</p><p><em>PayPal Fee Payment</em><br />If this option is selected, the Press Manager must decide between a testing- or production-level URL to interact with PayPal's Instant Payment Notification (IPN) service, and must enter the correct seller account email address into the form provided.</p><p>Users will be given the ability to sign into PayPal and pay a fee wherever fee payment is required: at time of monograph submission, for example. After PayPal has processed the payment, the user will be prompted to return to the press site and the processed fee will be added automatically to the Records page.</p>]]>
