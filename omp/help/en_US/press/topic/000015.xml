		<![CDATA[<p>The Press Manager is responsible for managing the publishing system. This does not involve any advanced technical skills, but entails filling out templates and uploading files. The Press Manager does the {help_topic key="press.managementPages.setup" text="Setup"} for the press, and enrolls the Editors, Acquisitions Editors, Copyeditors, Layout Editors, Proofreaders, and Reviewers. Alternately, names and emails of Reviewers, if they already exist in another database, can be imported into the system, through the Import People function under {help_topic key="press.managementPages.importExport" text="Import/Export Data"}. The Press Manager also has access to the press's other management systems, and can create new Sections for the press, edit the default set of Emails the system uses, manage the {help_topic key="press.managementPages.readingTools" text="Reading Tools"} that are available with this press, and see to the {help_topic key="press.managementPages.statsAndReports" text="Press Statistics"} the system can generate.</p><p>Note that although the Press Manager role is ostensibly a per-press role, press managers should generally be considered system-wide trusted users, as they have the ability to assume the identities of other users who may be enrolled in other presses.</p>]]>
