		<![CDATA[<p>The Merge Users feature, available from Press Management under the Users heading, allows the Press Manager to merge two user accounts into a single account, transferring edit assignments, submissions, and numerous other records from one account to the other and effectively deleting the first.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Monograph authorship</li>
				<li>Public comments on monographs</li>
				<li>Monograph notes</li>
				<li>Editor assignments and decisions</li>
				<li>Review assignments</li>
				<li>Layout editor assignments</li>
				<li>Proofreader assignments</li>
				<li>Monograph email and event log entries</li>
				<li>Reviewer access keys</li>

			</ul>
		<p>The following items are <strong>not</strong> transferred:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sessions</li>
				<li>Subscriptions</li>
				<li>Notification status (i.e. whether the user has signed up to receive notifications about press news)</li>
