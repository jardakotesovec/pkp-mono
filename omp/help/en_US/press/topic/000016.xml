		<![CDATA[<p>The Editor oversees the entire editorial and
publishing process. The Editor, working with the Press Manager, typically
establishes the policies and procedures for the press, which are entered in
{help_topic key="press.managementPages.setup" text="Setup"}. In the Editorial
Process, the Editor assigns submissions to the Acquisitions Editors to see
through Submission Review and Submission Editing. The Editor keeps an eye on the
submission's progress and assists with any difficulties. Once review is
completed, the Editor typically sees the submission through the {help_topic
key="editorial.acquisitionsEditorsRole.editing" text="Editing"} process
(including copyediting, layout, and proofreading) although in some presses this
remains the responsibility of the Acquisitions Editor in charge of the
submission's {help_topic key="editorial.acquisitionsEditorsRole.review"
text="Review"} process. The Editor also schedules submissions for publication,
arranges the Table of Contents and publishes the monograph as part of the
{help_topic key="publishing.index" text="Publishing Process"}. The Editor can
restore archived submissions to the active In Review or In Editing lists as
outlined in {help_topic key="editorial.editorsRole.submissions.archives"
text="Archives"}.</p>]]>
