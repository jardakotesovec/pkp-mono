		<![CDATA[<p>The Acquisitions Editor manages the Review and Editing of submissions to which they have been assigned. In some cases, a Acquisitions Editor who is assigned to see submissions through the {help_topic key="editorial.acquisitionsEditorsRole.review" text="Review"} Process will also be responsible for seeing the submissions that are accepted through the {help_topic key="editorial.acquisitionsEditorsRole.editing" text="Editing"} process (that is, through copyediting, layout, and proofreading). Often, however, Acquisitions Editors only work with the Review process, and an Editor, acting in the role of Acquisitions Editor, sees the submissions through the Editing process. The press will have a policy on how the tasks are divided.</p>]]>
