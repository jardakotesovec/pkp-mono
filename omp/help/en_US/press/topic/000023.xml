		<![CDATA[<p>Readers include both subscribers for presses for
which access is subscription-based, and readers who choose to register for open
access presses (whether immediately open access or open after a period of time
after initial publication of press content). Registered Readers receive a
notification email with the publication of each monograph, which includes the Table
of Contents. On registering themselves with the press,
Authors are given the option of enrolling as Readers as well.</p><p>More
