		<![CDATA[<p>OMP supports subscription presses by providing a
subscription management component and a corresponding password protection for
the press's online content. The subscriptions can be managed for individual
users, organizations or institutions. A subscription press can also offer free
access to its previously published monographs through a form of delayed open access. In Monograph
Management, the Editor allows readers free access to the content of a monograph or
individual monographs from zero to 24 months after their initial publication and
availability to subscribers.</p><p>A press's Managers, Editors, Acquisitions
Editors, Layout Editors, Copyeditors, and Proofreaders are always free to access
the press as though they were subscribers.</p><p><em>Deploying the subscription
module</em>. The Press Manager must indicate in Setup, 4.1 Access and Security
Settings, that the press will be using this system to manage its subscriptions
and that someone, enrolled as a Press Manager or Subscription Manager, has been
designated to manage this feature.</p>]]>

		<![CDATA[<p><em>Setting up the Subscription Types</em>. The
first step in setting up the subscription management is to designate the types
of subscriptions the press offers. Presses typically offer, for example,
individual subscription and institutional subscription rates. Some presses may
have special offers for members of an organization or students. OMP will support
the management of print and/or online subscriptions. More than one type of
subscription can be created to cover longer periods of time (12 months, 36
months).</p><p><em>Options for Subscription Types</em>. For "institutional"
subscriptions, use the "validated via domain or IP authentication" option, as
all members of the institution, coming in from its associated domain or IP
address, will be permitted access without a password. Similarly, the "members of
an association or organization" option should be used for membership
subscriptions, whether free to members or at a discount.  Use the "publicly
visible" option to make the subscription type and its fee appear under
Subscriptions on the About the Press. While most subscription types are
typically displayed in About, a type created for internal accounting, staff
subscriptions, and/or management purposes, for example, would not appear on the
About page.</p>]]>

		<![CDATA[<p><em>Creating Subscriptions</em>. For individual
subscribers, the Press (Subscription) Manager has to register the subscriber as
a reader, if not already registered, and then on the Create Subscriptions page,
enter the type and dates for the subscription. On saving this information, the
subscriber will be emailed a username, which will work with all content the
press publishes until the user is deleted from the Subscriptions list by the
Press Manager.</p><p><em>Institutional and organizational subscriptions</em>.
For institutional subscriptions, the contact person at the institution needs to
be enrolled as a reader, and then selected by the Press (Subscription) Manager
on the Create Subscriptions page. The contact person will need to provide the
institution's domain and/or IP addresses, which are used to validate the
account, sparing individual users at the institution the need to have user
accounts in order to access subscription content. Organizations with membership
lists can have those lists imported into the system, through the Import User
function in Press Management.</p>]]>

		<![CDATA[<p>Under Subscription Policies, the Press Manager can
enter Subscription Manager contact information, which will appear in About the
Press; enter additional information about subscriptions to appear in About the
Press (subscription types and the fee structure will already appear there); set
subscription expiry reminders; set open access options; and define an Author
self-archiving policy, also to appear in About the Press.</p>]]>
