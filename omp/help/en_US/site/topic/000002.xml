		<![CDATA[<p>OMP is designed to be a multi-press system, and the Site Administrator is responsible for configuring site-level settings and creating new presses to be hosted within a single site. Press sites are entirely independent, with the exception of user accounts; while a user may participate in any combination of roles and presses, the same email address and username will refer to the same user regardless of press.</p>]]>
	</section>
	
	<section title="Site Settings">
		<![CDATA[<p>Basic information is entered by the Site Administrator that is applicable to all presses hosted by the site, including the site title and description, and contact information.</p>
		<p><em>Press Redirect.</em> This setting can be used to ensure that all requests are redirected to a particular press web site. Typically this setting is used when a site is hosting a single press.</p>]]>
	</section>
	
	<section title="Hosted Presses">
		<![CDATA[<p>As OMP allows any number of individual and distinct press web sites to be generated, new presses can be created and managed at any time. Each press that is created can be accessed through a unique URL based on a path name entered by the Site Administrator. Presses that are currently in the process of being set up and configured can be hidden from the main site until such time that they are ready to go live.</p>]]>

	<section title="Languages">
		<![CDATA[<p>OMP is designed to be a multilingual system, allowing presses supporting a wide variety of languages to be hosted under a single site. The Site Administrator can specify the default language of the site and install additional locales as they become available to make other languages available for use by presses.</p>
		<p>Additional language packages will typically be available for download from the Open Monograph Press <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/" target="_blank">web site</a> as user-contributed translations are received. These packages can be installed into an existing OMP system to make them available to presses.</p>]]>

	<section title="Authentication Sources">
		<![CDATA[<p>By default, OMP authenticates users against its internal database. It is possible, however, to use other methods of authentication, such as LDAP. Additional authentication sources are implemented as OMP plugins; refer to the documentation shipped with each plugin for details.</p>]]>
