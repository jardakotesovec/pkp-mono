		<![CDATA[<p>The Help document for Open Monograph Press (OMP) is designed to assist users in the process of reading, submitting, editing, and publishing items in scholarly and general&mdash;interest presses. It is also intended to serve as a manual for OMP that describes the scope and workings of this press management software. The Help document also provides editorial advice on common press practices in scholarly publishing. In addition to this Help document, users have access to this press's technical support person, who will be listed in About the Press, under Contact.</p><p>Because OMP employs designated publishing roles or titles for each function and process &mdash; from the Press Manager who sees to the press's Setup to the Author who proofreads the galleys &mdash; each topic covered in Help refers to whichever role should be performing each task. On the same principle, access to the document is determined by who is doing what where within the system. Help is context specific; what one sees depends on one's role. Users can have more than one role in OMP (a Reviewer can also be an Author and a Press Manager can also be an Editor). What one sees also depends on where one is working within OMP. The role and location determine which Help topics come up, although the user can browse from there to related topics in order to explore any aspect of the system.</p><p><em>Search</em> In the upper right hand corner of each help page is a "Search" link.  Enter a key word and you will get a listing of the applicable help items, brief description of each item and a link to the item.</p><p><em>Table of Contents</em> Clicking on this link produces a table of contents of the available help.</p><p><em>Up a Level</em> Clicking on this link takes you up one level in the help hierarchy.  For example, if you where looking at "Files Browser", one level up would be "Management Pages".</p>]]>
