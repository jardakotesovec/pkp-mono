Upgrading an OJS Installation from OJS < 2.3
--------------------------------------------

Note that upgrades from OJS 2.0.x, 2.1.x, and 2.2.x directly to 3.0 or newer
are not directly supported. In order to upgrade from one of these versions of
OJS, it will be necessary to first upgrade via an interim OJS 2.3.x or 2.4.x
installation.
