\f0\b\fs64 \cf0 OJS 2.0 QA/Testing Tasks
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\
\

\f0\b\fs48 General Notes/Comments
\f1\b0\fs24 \
- Except where particularly critical, this document does not explicitly list separate test cases in situations where multiple choices may be available (e.g., a form with "OPTION X" or "OPTION Y"). It is assumed that for such situations each available option would be tested (and multiple combinations of different options where applicable).\
- Changes to improve instructional/descriptive text are not bugs and should be recorded separately and sent through John. This excludes issues that are legitimate bugs (e.g., a mislabeling of a email field as "Username", or an unlocalized message key like "user.username" in place of "Username").\
- It is assumed that entered data will be verified to have been recorded correctly (e.g., after registering a user, retrieving the user's profile to verify that the data was stored).\
- It is assumed that forms will be tested with invalid data to ensure that an appropriate error is generated (e.g., entering an invalid email address in user registration, entering HTML [or malicious XSS code] where HTML content is not allowed, or entering a negative number where a positive value is expected).\
\
\

\f0\b\fs48 Test Configurations
\f1\b0\fs24 \
- Primary test machine is research2 (Debian Sid, kernel 2.4.2x).\
- If possible, it would be nice to set up a second machine with a recent Red Hat/Fedora Core install (with kernel 2.6.x?) as well.\
- Non-Linux test installations (Mac OS X, Windows, etc.) would be useful if time permits but not critical.\
- PHP 5.0 came out recently, so it would be useful to officially support it as well.\
