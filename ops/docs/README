About
-----
Open Journal Systems (OJS) has been developed by the Public Knowledge Project.
For more information about OJS and other open research systems, visit our web
site at <http://www.pkp.ubc.ca/>.


License
-------
OJS is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the file
docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.


System Requirements
-------------------
Recommended:
	* PHP >= 4.2.x
	* MySQL >= 3.23.23 or PostgreSQL >= 7.1
	* Apache >= 1.3.2x or >= 2.0.4x
	* Operating system: Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X

Other versions or platforms may work but are not supported or have not been
tested.


Installation
------------
To install OJS:
	1. Extract the OJS archive into your web documents directory.
	2. Make the following files and directories writeable:
	   * config.inc.php (optional -- if not writable you will be prompted to
	     manually overwrite this file during installation)
	   * locale/cache
	   * public
	   * templates/t_cache
	   * templates/t_compile
	3. Open a web browser to <http://yourdomain.com/path/to/ojs/> and follow
	   the on-screen installation instructions.


Localization
------------
To add support for other languages, the following sets of files must be
localized and placed in an appropriately named directory:
	* locale/en_US/*.xml
	* dbscripts/xml/data/locale/en_US/*.xml
	* help/en_US/toc/*.xml
	* help/en_US/topic/*.xml

Server requirements for full Unicode (UTF-8) support:
	* MySQL >= 4.1.1 or PostgreSQL >= 7.x
	* PHP >= 4.3.0 compiled with support for the mbstring library


Scheduled Tasks
---------------
OJS supports a mechanism to execute a variety of tasks at scheduled times
(such as automatic sending of reminder notification emails).

To enable support for using scheduled tasks, edit your config.inc.php and
set the scheduled_tasks setting to On, and set up your operating system to
periodically execute (as the same user your webserver is running under) the
PHP script found at tools/runScheduledTasks.php in your OJS directory:

On *nix operating systems, this can be done by adding a simple cron task:
	# crontab -e www
	0 * * * *	php /path/to/ojs2/tools/runScheduledTasks.php
In this example the script would be executed every hour.

If using the scheduled tasks script, it is recommended that the script be
set up to execute at least once per day.
Note that using the script also requires you to have the PHP command-line
interpreter installed on your server.


Third-party Libraries
---------------------
	* See lib/libraries.txt for a list of third-party libaries used by this
	  application.
