# PKP UI Library

This library contains UI components implemented or planned for the Public Knowledge Project's applications [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) and [Open Monograph Press](https://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/).

It provides a demonstration of each component, technical documentation, and usage guidance. It is intended for technical developers who want to work with the editorial backend UI.

You should only need to consult this guide if you want to make substantial changes to the editorial backend. These may include:

- Create a new page with your own components
- Replace an existing page with a custom version
- Maintain or improve the existing components
- Learn how to write your own components
