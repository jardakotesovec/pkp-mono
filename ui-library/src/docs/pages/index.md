# PKP UI Library

This library contains design patterns implemented or planned for the Public Knowledge Project's applications [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) and [Open Monograph Press](https://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/).

This style guide is intended to help orient developers to the existing components, outline markup guidelines, and provide details on how to adhere to accessibility requirements.

The style guide components are for demonstration purposes. In most cases, they are not fully functional and do not provide complete documentation. **You should consult the source code for these components**.
