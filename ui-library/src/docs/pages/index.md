# UI Library

This library contains UI components used by the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca)'s applications [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/), [Open Preprint Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops/) and [Open Monograph Press](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp/). It is intended for coders who want to contribute to the software and developers who want to build plugins that integrate with the UI of the editorial backend.

This library is a static site used to document the components and provide a convenient development environment to build and test new components. To learn how to integrate the UI Library with an application's frontend, read our [developer documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/frontend).

The library uses Vue 3, but most components are written using the Vue 2 syntax. In order to make it is easy for the team to maintain the UI Library, it is important to keep the code consistent between components. Use the Vue 2 syntax for new components until a decision is made to migrate all components to the Vue 3 syntax.
