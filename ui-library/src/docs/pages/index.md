# PKP UI Library

This library contains design patterns implemented or planned for the Public Knowledge Project's applications Open Journal Systems and Open Monograph Press.

This document is intended to help orient developers to the existing components, outline markup guidelines, and provide details on how to adhere to accessibility requirements.

The components in this guide are not functional and do not provide complete documentation. **In all cases, you should consult the source code for these components.**
