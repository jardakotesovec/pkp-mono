# Elements

Elements are composed of HTML and can be written into any component.

## Spinner

<div class="pkpul-element">
	<div class="pkpul-element__preview">
		<span class="pkpSpinner" aria-hidden="true"></span>
	</div>
```
	<span class="pkpSpinner" aria-hidden="true"></span>
```
</div>

Use the spinner to indicate when a request is pending, a component is loading or the user must wait for some activity to complete.
