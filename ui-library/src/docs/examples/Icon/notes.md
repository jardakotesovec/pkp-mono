## Usage Guidance

Use icons when you want to visually connect two parts of the UI that are not otherwise connected. For example, the [ListPanel](/#/components/ListPanel) filters use an icon to link the button with the panel it controls.

### Be careful when using icon-only labels

You may want to use icon-only labels when fitting a lot of information into a small space. Such icon-based display can be useful for presenting dense information, but these patterns tend to favor experienced users over novice ones. Use with caution.

### Avoid decorative icons

When adding buttons or other controls, do not add an icon when the text label sufficiently describes the action.

## Help Icon

The `info-circle` icon is reserved for providing help on how to use the software.

## Warning Icon

The `exclamation-triangle` icon is reserved for warning the user about an error or a serious consequence of an expected action.
