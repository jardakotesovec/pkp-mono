Use this component to add short tips that appear above a button.

## Usage Recommendations

Use the tooltip when you want to provide short advice on how to complete a task. If the advice can not be fit in 25-30 words, consider using a [HelpButton](/#/components/HelpButton) instead.

Do _not_ use the tooltip for information that the user requires to complete a task. Most users will not interact with the tooltip, so you should not rely on them reading the information.
