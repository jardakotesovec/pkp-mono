Use the `Notification` component to draw the user's attention to new information.

Do not overuse `Notification`s. If they become too common, they will no longer draw the user's attention.

Only use the `info` type for information that would otherwise be placed in a tooltip or in the in-app help area. Typically, this is used to provide descriptive information about an action the user is undertaking, such as completing a form. In this context, it may be appropriate to restyle the notification so that it is less prominent.
