Use this component for entering a single line of text.

The `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field. Choose a size that is sufficient to display the expected input.

When using a `prefix`, be careful not to use a long prefix. There may not be enough room for the user to enter their information. If a prefix runs too long, it will be truncated so that the user can enter their information.
