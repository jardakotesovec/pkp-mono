Use this component to provide the user with a rich text input area that supports bold, italics, links and other HTML code.

This component uses the TinyMCE editor. You can pass `toolbar`, `plugins` and `init` props to customize the editor. See the [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/).

The `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field.

The default `size` is best for one to two large paragraphs. If you expect a user to enter more than that, consider using the large size when it fits appropriately within the the form where it appears.
