The `StatsContainer` extends the [`Container`](/#/pages/container) app. Use this app to show a page of statistics with a chart and a table.

## Template

The `StatsContainer` app is a template-less component. You must write the template in Smarty on the server-side and it will be compiled at run time.

The example here provides a sample template, similar to the article statistics page.
