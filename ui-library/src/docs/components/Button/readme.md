Use this component to display a button for an action.

## Links vs Buttons

The link element, `<a>`, should only be used for actions which navigate away from the current page. When opening modals or performing actions on the same page, use the `<button>` element.

This is a good rule of thumb: if the URL changes when the action is clicked, use `<a>`. Otherwise, use `<button>`.
